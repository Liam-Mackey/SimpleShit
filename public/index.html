    <p>Today embarked on my first Machine Learning Project. It was simple and could, if need be, be condensed down to just nine lines of python. The idea here was inspired by a blog post that gave instructions on how to build your very own neural network from scratch. Although mine wasnâ€™t as much a network as it was just one Neuron. The code I wrote basically came down to just performing some Matrix multiplication on a few input nodes with a little back propagation thrown in there.</p>

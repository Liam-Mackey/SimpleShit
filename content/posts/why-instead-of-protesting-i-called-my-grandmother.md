**To start I just want to say that this is in no way, shape, or form a criticism of anyone who protested today.** I support you and what you are doing. I just want to share my reason for doing something other than protesting, despite thinking many of the same troubled thoughts about this new administration as you the average protester. So with out further ado I will begin my rant.

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States yesterday. Huge numbers of American citizens took to the streets today to protest the new administration. I did not. </span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">Before you</span> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.18px;">criticize</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">me for being a passive pseudo-liberal who really doesn't care about the rights of</span> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.18px;">minorities</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;"> or women. Let me explain my reason for not protesting. </span>  

It begins with my cynical worldview. I do not believe that great change occurs through great momentous events. I believe that every great change has been rather overhyped as a "Momentous" event in history. But is rather the point when many smaller changes have hit critical mass and then cause a bubble to burst. I also believe that by attempting to take on large adversaries whether in life or in politics is rather ineffective and in many ways counter productive. However, attempting to attack and change small areas of ones life or the political system is in fact a much more successful approach to getting what one wants in any area of life. 

Protesting the Trump administration on its first day in office IS an effective way to let the media and government know how upset the majority of americans are with this new transition of power. And if that was your goal in protesting then I can say, from watching the news tonight, you have succeeded in your objective. I believe with a high level of confidence that before 4am rolls around you will have created a tweet storm larger then your average F5 tornado.

If you have the idea that by protesting you will somehow make Trump step down or cause any noticeable change in the actions his administration will take, I think you may be disappointed. Unless you are a highly skilled assassin or a Russian whore with a hidden video camera, I don't think you stand a chance about changing Trump's mind about remaining in office. 

If we want to remove Trump from office we have 4 years to do it. To remove him from office we need to see what in fact got him in office in the first place. **Fear**. Trump's most successful tactic in getting the nations highest office was appealing to the fears of people with a large amount of anxiety about the change they see happening in their lives. Trump mostly appealed to working class uneducated white males. The people most likely to see a negative change in lifestyle with the marching progress of globalization and technological automation.

The people who voted for Trump are scared that their way of life is going to disappear.

title = "Code Monkeys: Why Programming is the Blue Collar White Collar Job "

+++
Let me begin by saying that this is just my opinion, I am basing this post of no real world statistics. It is my belief though that Coding/Programming/Development/Software Engineering, what ever you want to call it, shares many aspects with traditionally "Blue Collar" jobs, despite being considered a white collar job.

What does a programmer do? Despite what many people think professional software engineering, for most developers, does not involve solving complex mathematical equations or furiously typing away at a keyboard building an application from scratch. 

For most developers, our time is usually spent on maintenance and feature addition on existing codebases. Most of this programming does not involve complex Gauss Jordan matrices, complex data structures, and unreadable recursive functions, like we learned in school. Instead most of our daily activities revolve around. Implementing new features to existing codebases or fixing bugs in other peoples code. 

We generally work with Project Managers and Clients who do not have any idea what we do. They see the confusing characters and numbers on our computer screens and think what we do requires a complex knowledge of mathematics and engineering principles. To be fair, sometimes what we do does require complex mathematics, extensive knowledge of engineering and design principles, and complex data structures. This is why we took Algorithms and Data structures courses in college. But for the most part we are code monkeys.

Like a plumber, electrician, or carpenter, we usually get called in when something breaks or somebody wants to add something to an existing application. The steps to fixing a kitchen sink and implen

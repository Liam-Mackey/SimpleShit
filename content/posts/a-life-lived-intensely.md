+++


I live life with an intensity not found in many other people. My highs are glorious, I feel like I am king of the world. My lows are devastating I feel that I always will be and always have been a miserable person. My entire life has consisted of finding a balance between these meteoric rises and catastrophic free falls. Sometimes I am in a normal place where I can think straight and contemplate how crazy life is. Sometimes that contemplation leads to a depressed feeling of will I ever be normal? Other times that contemplation leads to a feeling of awe. The awe that I get to experience the human condition to such extremes, that at 23 I have seen more of the emotional spectrum then most 80 year olds. When I am on a high I love my mind; when I am low it is quite the opposite. Most of the time though I wouldn’t trade any of my experiences, even the crippling depression, for the world.

Sometimes the intensity of mood causes changes in my perception. Sometimes I feel that I am being watched when I am clearly not. Sometimes I think I can know what other people are thinking about me. Sometimes the colors seem brighter, and the vivid imagery of life seems far to beautiful. Sometimes it is so beautiful it is scary. Sensory overload of things that no one else can sense if you will.

Most people think of me as just a average Joe. They think I lived a normal life and have a normal brain. Most people don’t know that there is a file on me 500 pages thick in a psychiatrists office in long island.

I hesitate to say that I am “Mentally Ill” because these are labels that have a very negative connotation. These labels do not even remotely come close to describing who I am. I am not “Mentally Ill”, I am Liam. I am a complex individual with a wide variety of emotions.

There was a time when I was younger and newly diagnosed where I identified with my “Illness” and I really thought there was something wrong with me. Over time I have come to realize that that is simply not true. I am a complex individual and one “Diagnosis” does not define me even remotely. I chose not to think of myself as a person with an illness. I chose to think that I get to experience a unique flavor of the human adventure that most other people miss out on. I live life with an intensity not found among many others. I didn’t choose to live live with this intensity and sometimes I wish I didn’t but it is who I am.

I live a good life. I have a fulfilling career and wonderful relationships. There were a lot of people when I was first diagnosed 10 years ago, myself included, who would have never seen this life for me. I hope that my success with the intense condition can inspire others who live life intensely to aim high.

Just because you are told that you have a “Disorder”, is no reason to think you can’t do anything that anyone else can do and more.

It has been over 10 years from the time I was first told that I was different. Not gonna lie, the first 8 years of those 10 were pretty rough. I experienced a lot and I have a lot more to experience, but now I have the skills to live a good life with this intensity.

I hope that anyone who reads this and has been told by a medical professional that they might not be able to live a normal life, can look at me and let me be a testament to the fact that you can live a wonderful “Normal” life even if you are different.

If you or a loved one is dealing with a mental illness and you would like my perspective don’t hesitate to reach out. liammac21@gmail.com.

I will leave you with this, as a reminder that it gets better.

+++

I have a secret. One that I hide from most people in my life. It is not that I have done something wrong. It is not that I have lied about anything. My secret is kept hidden because many people fear, stigmatize, and discredit people with my secret. My secret is that I have Schizophrenia.

Before I go into what Schizophrenia is or how it has effected my life I'd like to tell you a bit about myself. I am a Software Engineer at a wonderful company. I am well compensated for my work and I am lucky enough that I can live alone in New York City. I have many friends, some whom I am very close with. I have a wonderful girlfriend who I have been with for a year.  I live a full and rich life. But it wasn't always that way.

After my second suicide attempt at age 13 I spent a week in a children's psychiatric hospital. Upon release I was assigned a state appointed social worker who I would work with for many years to come. This was my first real encounter with the mental health system. I remember watching a woman screaming and hiding under a blanket in the emergency psych ward. I remember sleeping on a stretcher with the neon lights on in a locked observation room because the hospital did not have any beds for me. I remember being put into restraints for transfer to another hospital. I remember witnessing a stabbing and multiple fights from my brief stay in the inpatient unit. I remember a lot of things I wish I didn't.

Schizophrenia is a broad illness. In fact in recent editions of the DSM 5, the rule book for diagnosing mental illness, Schizophrenia is described on a spectrum. Schizophrenia can also be comorbid with other conditions. When Schizophrenia is comorbid with either Major Depression or Bipolar disorder this is called Schizoaffective disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is the intersection of mood illness and psychosis. Although people with depression and bipolar disorder can experience psychosis in periods of extreme mood fluctuation, people with schizoaffective disorder experience psychosis as a dominant part of their illness. To qualify for schizoaffective disorder you need to experience psychosis without mood fluctuations for at least 2 weeks.

Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder, my two comorbid conditions express themselves differently depending on the patient. To sum up the symptoms of my condition briefly I experience high swings in mood, depressions that get so low I lose 20 pounds in a month and think about suicide. I also experience elevated moods where I feel like I can do anything, I get little sleep, grandiose thoughts, and exhibit reckless behaviors. To qualify for Schizoaffective disorder psychosis is the dominant player in my life. I have experienced delusions that I could read minds, paranoid thinking that the government was after me, or grandiosity that celebrities were infatuated with me and sending me letters in my neighbors mailboxes. By far the dominant feature of my illness is hallucinations. Even with my medication and therapy I still have auditory hallucinations almost daily. When I become very ill for a period of time I will also experience visual and tactile hallucinations.

These symptoms are quite debilitating. I started hearing voices when I was 13. I remember being terrified by the cacophony of incessant noises in my head. I remember growing paranoid that everyone I knew was after me, trying to lock me away in a hospital forever or kill me.

These beliefs and frequent mood swings caused me to exhibit strange and avoidant behavior. Between ages 13 and 16 I barely saw anyone other than family outside of school. I grew distant from many of my friends out of paranoia and the delusion that I could read their minds and all they thought of me was criticisms.

This continued throughout my high school years. I planned on killing myself at 18, luckily my social worker talked me down, nearly literally. My care givers and the guidance counselors at the school decided I wasn't fit for college. I spent most of my late teens struggling to stay alive and out of hospitals and jails as my psychosis grew worse and worse. I cycled through dozens of psychotropic medications and they would often work for a period of time then the symptoms would return. By the age of 19 I was on SSI disability and being told I should apply for food stamps and section 8 housing.

Luckily with the support from my family and social worker I earned an online college degree and began to partake heavily in computer programming. I got a full time job as a Junior developer while most of my friends were still in college. My life began to shape up.

There have definitely been some road bumps along the way. I briefly stopped taking my medication and that led me to a third, luckily unsuccessful suicide attempt, also I have learned that my symptoms will likely reappear every now and again throughput my life. My auditory hallucinations will likely be chronic throughout the rest of my life. I hear voices at least once a day now, and my doctor told me even with medication thats not likely to change. It is just something I have to live with.

But living with the symptoms of Bipolar disorder and Schizophrenia is possible. I am lucky that I work a job where I can listen to music all day to drown out the auditory hallucinations and if I get too depressed or manic I can work from home or take a sick day if it is needed.

**A fulfilling life with severe mental illness is possible.**

That is not to say that there are not challenges, I still struggle with my symptoms daily and face stigma when people find out about my condition but over the last 13 years I have learned ways to cope. I have Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder but I am not defined by my illness. Before either of those things I am a friend, a coworker, a partner, and a survivor.

To those living with severe mental illness, I want to let you know that you can succeed. Do not let the limitations other people put on you define you. You are stronger than most. Battling your mind every day is one of the hardest things a person can do. But you are doing it, and the more you do it the better you will get at it.

In 6 years I went from food stamps, disability, and spending my days at a care center. To living on my own in New York City, becoming a successful computer programmer, having close friends, and being in a wonderful relationship with a person I love dearly.

**You are not defined by your severe mental illness.**

The measure of a man is not his success, but his ability to overcome adversity. And if you are living with either Schizophrenia or Bipolar disorder, or both, you have certainly overcome more adversity than most.

I'd like to end this post with a poem I memorized back when I was first hearing voices and having delusions. It has given me strength in my times of darkness on multiple occasions.

> Out of the night that covers me,
>
> Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
>
> I thank whatever gods may be
>
> For my unconquerable soul.
>
> In the fell clutch of circumstance
>
> I have not winced nor cried aloud.
>
> Under the bludgeonings of chance
>
> My head is bloody, but unbowed.
>
> Beyond this place of wrath and tears
>
> Looms but the Horror of the shade,
>
> And yet the menace of the years
>
> Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.
>
> It matters not how strait the gate,
>
> How charged with punishments the scroll,
>
> I am the master of my fate:
>
> I am the captain of my soul.
